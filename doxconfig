# Set the DOT_MULTI_TARGETS tag to YES to allow dot to generate multiple output
# files in one run (i.e. multiple -o and -T options on the command line). This
# makes dot run faster, but since only newer versions of dot (>1.8.10) support
# this, this feature is disabled by default.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.

# If the GENERATE_LEGEND tag is set to YES doxygen will generate a legend page
# explaining the meaning of the various boxes and arrows in the dot generated
# graphs.
# The default value is: YES.
# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.

GENERATE_LEGEND        = YES

# If the DOT_CLEANUP tag is set to YES, doxygen will remove the intermediate dot
# files that are used to generate the various graphs.
# The default value is: YES.
# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.
